There has been a rise in fake job postings over the years owing to the rapid influx of users in the digital world. Factors such as COVID-19 and the impending global recession have completely disrupted the job market and resulted in massive layoffs. More than 20,700 business and employment opportunity scams were reported in the first quarter of 2022, with roughly a third of them causing financial losses for the victims. The recent hiring freezes and large-scale layoffs by tech giants like Google, Facebook and Apple are further proof that the global job market is going downhill.

This rise in unemployment has set the stage for scammers to prey upon the people who are barely hanging on by a thread in regards to their financial position. These scammers post fraudulent promises of a job to entice job seekers into applying. More often than not, these job offers contain extremely lucrative career opportunities which occasionally demand investment from the applicant. Even if no investment is necessary, these fraudulent job postings allow con artists to get personal information such as bank account information, social security number, addresses etc. This information may later be used for identity theft or financial fraud.

Our focus is on predicting, with adequate precision, if a particular job posting is real or fake based on the information provided in the post.
